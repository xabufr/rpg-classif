A caracter is something you can see on a living being, it permits you to tidy it in a box, what you'll do later. For example my feathers, it is a caracteristic.\nUnderstood ? Ok let's go. I've got an internal skeleton with bones. To move I use my 2 inferior members, I've also got 2 wings which are my superior members but I can't fly. What else... oh. I've got a gizzard but it's not important... of course I also got a head and a mouth as you can see !"

I have an  internal bone ssskeleton, a large jaw, and a head. My body is covered with ssscales, like all sssquamates. Now the most important: I have 4 legs. Well, I had. When I was sstill in my egg, in the form of an embryo, I had 4 small legs. As I grew, I lossst them. But Wengin always considers that I have 4 legs to place myself in the classsssification, because I had them one day. The 4 legs are therefore part of my attributes, so I am also a tetrapod!"

But my apprentice Toris made me prisoner and disorganized everything. He does not try to classify as I taught him, he arranges with criteria that are ... outdated. \n\n You do not seem expert in the field but I will teach you everything you have to know to classify this world the right way. \n Move with the arrows of your keyboard and join me a little further on the way."

Quite simple. You just have to meet the few creatures that are still there, they will tell you what their attributes are, I advise you to write them on a sheet as you go to remember. Once you know all the attributes, go to the top of Mount Phylo. There you will have to put each species in its place in the classification of the living.

So I advise you to click on the link at the top of the page, it is a picture of what Toris did ... he classified the animals according to their mode of travel, but it is not right As classification!
