    You cross the threshold of the cave and you see in the distance an immense picture, in which are written the names of the species that you crossed. Wengin appears next to you and exclaims: <br />
    <Em> "Name of a pipe!" Toris has categorized the creatures by their way of moving! For example the hen ... Y'en who will tell you that it does not fly really, Really put it in those who fly ... It's like the rabbit ... it does not always move by jumping, it can work too ... In short, this kind of classification is too subjective! , We want to classify objectively, with attributes, things on which everyone agrees! <br />
    Can you help me fix it? Write on your piece of paper what you think is the scientifically correct classification of this world, put creatures back in nested groups. You do not know how to do it? You have to put them in boxes, the biggest box corresponds to an attribute they all have, and then there are smaller boxes in those boxes and so on ... <br />
    Go I help you a little, the first box is the ANIMAL box. They are all those who have a mouth and a head. You then have in these boxes the box of insects that have 3 pairs of legs and 1 pair of antenna, and next to it the box of vertebrates that have a skeletal iterne bone ... Good go I will not you all more ! Just a small clue, the snake has scales like fish, but if you think well you will see that they are not in the same box! Always pay attention to the attributes you use to rank ... If you have a problem, I'm sure you'll find someone to help you around! </ Em> </ p>
